A need for a design decision that emerges from this is whether we should consider zero as a missing value or not. Zero can be a valid nutrient value for a lot of products (e.g. water has zero calories). On the other hand, we can easily imagine a scenario where a user fills in zero values for missing nutrient information during the product submission. We will continue our provisional analysis by considering zeros as valid values. However this is something we will re-evaluate during our analysis."

It should be noted that our information is per 100g/ml and not per serving, which means that the nutrients are not directly comparable. For example, one would normally eat a much smaller quantity of salt (in grams) compared to yoghurt. Interestingly enough, the nutrient profiling system used for the calculation of the _NutriScore_ does not seem to account for this issue and calculates the nutritional rating directly on the 100g/ml values instead.
