Healthy Candies
========


***If you are our ADA reviewer, you would be interested in looking at [this other README](./README_MS3.md).***

## Introduction

This repo gathers the several data analyses we performed on the Open Food Fact database in the context of the final project in the Applied Data Analysis course @EPFL.

The analyses we performed are available in the `notebooks` directory.


**We have also created a [*data story*](https://ada-healthy-candies.github.io/) that might be more enjoyable :wink:.**



## Set up


Create a virtual environment inside the project, activate it and install the dependencies:


```sh
python3 -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


To have everything work properly, it is also recommended to install the python package associated with the project:
```sh
pip install -e .
```



Run `python ./init_project.py` to set up all the required data for the project to run correctly.
